description: >
  The DARPA TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus is a
  benchmark dataset designed for the development and evaluation of
  automatic speech recognition systems. It contains 6300 utterances
  spoken by 630 speakers from 8 major dialect regions of the United States.
  In this work, TIMIT is used as a few-shot speaker classification dataset.

classes:
  type: speakers
  count: 630
  unit: speaker_id

samples:
  total_utterances: 6300
  utterances_per_class: 10

splits:
  train: TRAIN
  test: TEST

preprocessing:
  sample_rate: 16000
  mono: true
  max_duration_seconds: 1.0
  normalization: mean_std
  padding: zero_pad

  reason: >
    The full dataset is large for rapid experimentation.
    Subsampling is used to control memory usage and speed up benchmarking.

notes: >
  Speaker identity is inferred from the directory structure.
  Phonetic annotations are not used in this setup.
  The dataset is well suited for few-shot speaker recognition
  and representation learning evaluation.
