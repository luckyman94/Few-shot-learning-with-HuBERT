dataset:
  name: synthetic_audio_noise
  type: synthetic

  description: >
    Synthetic audio dataset composed of pure sinusoidal signals with
    class-specific base frequencies. The dataset is designed to study
    the impact of additive noise on few-shot learning.
    The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be explicitly controlled,
    allowing the generation of low-noise or highly noisy datasets.

  task:
    type: audio_classification
    setting: few_shot_learning

  audio:
    sample_rate: 16000
    channels: mono
    duration: fixed
    max_length_samples: 16000

  data:
    num_classes: 8
    total_samples: 800
    samples_per_class: 100
    class_definition: base_frequency_shift

  noise:
    type: gaussian
    control_parameter: snr_db
    note: SNR can be adjusted to generate datasets with different noise levels
