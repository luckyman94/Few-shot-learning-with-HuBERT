  description: >
    UrbanSound8K is a dataset of short urban sound recordings,
    containing 8732 labeled sound excerpts of up to 4 seconds.
    The dataset covers 10 classes of common urban sounds drawn
    from an urban sound taxonomy and is widely used for
    environmental sound classification benchmarks.
