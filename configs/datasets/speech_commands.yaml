  description: >
    Balanced subset of the Google Speech Commands dataset.
    The original dataset contains approximately 16,600 audio files
    of spoken commands. For experimental efficiency and fair evaluation,
    we construct a reduced and class-balanced subset.

  task:
    type: audio_classification
    setting: few_shot_learning
    input: raw_audio
    output: command_label

  audio:
    format: wav
    sample_rate: 16000
    channels: mono
    duration: fixed
    max_length_samples: 16000
    normalization: mean_std

  classes:
    names:
      - down
      - left
      - off
      - on
      - right
      - stop
      - up
    num_classes: 7

  split:
    construction: balanced_sampling
    total_samples: 1000
    samples_per_class: 142
    strategy: random_sampling_per_class
    seed: 42

  preprocessing:
    - resample_to_16kHz
    - convert_to_mono
    - pad_or_truncate
    - waveform_normalization

  usage:
    benchmark:
      few_shot:
        n_way: 5
        k_shot: [1, 5]
        n_query: 10
        episodic: true

  notes:
    - Original dataset is highly unbalanced in size per class.
    - Subsampling ensures equal class representation.
    - Dataset is suitable for few-shot prototypical networks.
