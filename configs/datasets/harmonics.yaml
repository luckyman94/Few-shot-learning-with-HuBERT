  name: synthetic_audio_harmonics

    type: synthetic

  description: >
    Synthetic audio dataset designed to study the effect of harmonic richness
    on few-shot audio classification. Each class corresponds to a distinct
    fundamental frequency. The spectral complexity of the signals is controlled
    by varying the maximum number of harmonics added to the base sine wave.
    All other factors are kept fixed to isolate the influence of harmonics.

  notes:
    - No additive noise is applied in this dataset.
    - Harmonic richness is the only varying factor across configurations.
    - The dataset is intended for controlled analysis of spectral complexity
      in few-shot learning with HuBERT.
